# smart_polyhouse
Description of the project:-

A polyhouse is a specific kind of building that uses a regulated temperature for the growth of various plants and other agricultural requirements. To cover the building and divide the interior atmosphere from the exterior, we utilise polythene sheets. All sorts of polyhouse farming, from small farmers to commercial farming, can benefit by using IoT- based polyhouse farming technology. By monitoring and managing the temperature, humidity, light, and CO2 in the polyhouse, a grower may maximise crop quality, production and minimising impact of environmental factors such as climate, rainfall etc. IoT-based polyhouse farming systems are incredibly simple to use and can be accessed from any location using a smartphone, tablet, or computer with Internet. poly house is the latest methods being followed to grow certain types of vegetables, fruits and flowers to increase quality and productivity

Objectives:-

The objective of smart polyhouse farming are -
To provide a controlled environment for plants to grow.
Reduce water usage and pesticide/fertilizer use.
Increase crop yield and improve crop quality.

How to use this code :-

This code is used to maintain the temperature , soil moisture, humidity and light intensity by controlling the actuators such as ventilation fan, bulb and water spray.
